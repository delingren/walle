# IR Remote

Different manufacturers have different IR remote protocols. Many are either publicly available or has been reverse engineered. I happen to have a couple of Samsung remote controls. So I'll be using them. To decode the signals, I am using this [Arduino-IRremote library](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote).
