I used a [DFPlayer](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1121.html) in the first version and thought it was a bit expensive (~$20 at the time). But the price seems to have come down quite a bit. AliExpress even has some clones that costs only $1 a piece. It doesn't have internal flash. Instead, it reads from microSD cards. I have quite a few of microSD cards salvaged from all sorts of electronics found in e-waste bins.

So, let's see if it plays nicely with the RP2040-Zero.
